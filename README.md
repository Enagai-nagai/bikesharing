## Overview of the analysis: 
We are planning to launch share bike service in Des Moines. We are exploring the data of Citi Bike (in New York) in August 2019 in order to understand the share bike business and interest investors.

## Results: Using the visualizations you have in your Tableau Story
### User demographics
* More men use CitiBike than women, which is more dominant among subscribe users.
* The peak of users' age is in their late 20s.

### Popular places
* Most of Citibike trips are made in Manhattan area.

### Trip duration
* Most of Citibike trips last under 5 minutes.
* Very few trips last more than one hour.
* In this sense, there is no difference between male and female users

### Popular day of week/hour
#### Trend among Subscribe users
* They are likely to make trips from 7 to 9 am and from 5 to 7 pm during weekdays.
* Thursday is the most popular day 

#### Trend among Customers
* They make more trips during weekends rather than weekdays.
* Although Subscribe usage concentrates at certains hours as mentioned, Customers usage is more disperse.

## Summary: Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional visualizations that you would perform with the given dataset.

#### Usage situation
* According to what we learned from the explatory analysis, we can see the following
* There are typically two ways of usage (1) Subscriber for commute in the moring and evening (2) Customer for sightseeing/specific occasion use during weekend 
* The male population is much bigger than the female one. We would need to find out why men use more this service or why women are hesitant to use this service (probably security problem)

#### Consideration
* The share bike usage may change a lot in Des Moines, where I believe that cars are the most common transportation. People in NY might use the share bike to get a metro station, however people in Des Moines probably use the bike to get to the final destination or do not use bike because trip distance is too big.
